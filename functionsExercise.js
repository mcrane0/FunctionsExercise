// Functions Exercise
/*
1. Create a declaration function called fozzieBear that displays the string "Wocka Wocka!" in the console/terminal 
    when the function is run/executed. Run/execute the function.
2. Create another declaration function named beaker that has a parameter named speak. Using multiple console logs 
    in the function, have whatever is passed as an argument display 4 times in the console/terminal. Finally, 
    run/execute the function and pass "Meep" as the argument.
3. Create a function called muppetShow that has two parameters named a and b. Inside the function create a 
    conditional statement (A.K.A. If statement) where if the string argument "Muppet" is passed in for "a" AND 
    the string argument "Show" is passed in for "b", then "It's time to play the music. It's time to light the 
    lights." displays in the console/terminal when the function is run/executed. (NOTE: If anything other than 
        "Muppet" and "Show" are passed in as arguments for a and b, then the function should display nothing when 
        run/executed)
4. Create another declaration function called kermit that RETURNS the following string value "Kermit The Frog" 
    when it is run/executed
5. Create another declaration function called muppetShowSeasons that has a parameter named seasons. In the 
    function create a conditional statement where if the number argument passed for seasons is 5 have the function 
    RETURN the boolean value of true. Also, if it is NOT 5 have the function RETURN the boolean value of false.
6. Create a function expression that is a const variable called manOrMuppet which displays the following string 
    value when the function is run/executed "Am I a man or am I a Muppet?".
7. Create an Arrow function called rainbowConnection which RETURNS a string value of "Someday we'll find it. 
    The Rainbow Connection. The lovers, the dreamers and me" (Do this without using brackets "{}" or the return keyword)
8. QUESTION: If a let or const variable is created/declared inside a function, loop, or conditional can the value 
    of it be accessed outside of the function, loop, or conditional? (Just use a comment to answer yes or no)
9. QUESTION: If a let or const variable is created outside the scope of a function and the value of the variable 
    is updated inside a function, then assuming the function has been run, could the updated value of the variable 
    be accessed outside of the function (Again, just use a comment to answer yes or no)
10a. Create a const variable called newMuppetMovies and set the value to an array with the following values: 
    "The Muppets" and "Muppets Most Wanted"
10b. Using the Map method on the newMuppetMovies array, create an anonymous declaration function to pass as an 
    argument for the Map method that changes the letters of each array item to uppercase. Also, set the returned 
    value to a new const variable called upperMovies.

8: No

/*
11a. Create a const variable called oldMuppetMovies and set the value to an array with the following values: 
    "The Muppet Movie", "The Muppets Take Manhattan", "The Great Muppet Caper", "The Muppet Christmas Carol", 
    "Muppet Treasure Island" and "Muppets From Space"
11b. Using the Filter array method on the oldMuppetMovies array, create an anonymous arrow function to pass as an 
    argument for the Filter method that will return/create a new array with only the "The Great Muppet Caper" and 
    "Muppet Treasure Island" items in it. Also, set the value of the new array that is returned/created to a 
    const variable called twoMovies. (HINT: The length property)
12a. Create a const variable called charactersOne and set the value to an array with the following values: 
    "Statler" & "Waldorf"
12b. Create a const variable called charactersTwo and set the value to an array with the following values: 
    "The Swedish Chef", "Animal", and "Rowlf"
12c. Create an arrow function called randomMuppet with a parameter called characters that accepts an array of 
    strings for an argument. Inside the function use Math.random() and a console log to have the value of a 
    random item (AKA Character) in the array that is passed in display in the console/terminal (NOTE: You will 
    need more than just Math.random and a console log to complete this)
12d. Run/execute the randomMuppet function twice (Passing charactersOne as the argument for the first one 
    and charactersTwo for the second)
13. Create an arrow function called caps with a parameter called string that accepts a string argument and 
    RETURNS a new string value with every other letter capitalized starting with the first letter. For an 
    extra bonus have the function set up so that it ignores spaces (For Example it would change "Hello World" to 
    "HeLlO wOrLd" instead of "HeLlO WoRlD").
